Check mode independent mode In this mode all the nodes have two check states: checked and unchecked . Checking/unchecking a node does not affect the check state of its parent or child nodes. linked mode In this mode all the nodes have three check states: checked , unchecked and indeterminate . Checking/unchecking a node affects the check state of its parent and/or child nodes. If some but not all child nodes are checked then their parent node is in indeterminate check state and this state looks different than the checked and unchecked states. The mode has the following behaviour: checking a parent node also checks all its child nodes unchecking a parent node also unchecks all its child nodes checking a child node also changes its parent check state: checked or indeterminate (see above) unchecking a child node also changes its parent check state: unchecked or indeterminate (see above) Node state icons options.icons has the following state icons than contains icon classes: closedIcon : icon classes for the indication of the closed node state: treevue-default-arrow openIcon : icon classes for the indication of the open node state treevue-default-arrow expanded uncheckedIcon : icon classes for the indication of the unchecked node state treevue-default-checkbox checkedIcon : icon classes for the indication of the checked node state treevue-default-checkbox checked partiallyCheckedIcon : icon classes for the indication of the indeterminate node state treevue-default-checkbox indeterminate The above icon classes are default icons classed for the component.

If source items do not have such unique prop for every node then the component can assign unique identifiers to all the nodes itself. By default options.idProp=&#39;id&#39; . You can customize what exact prop to use as a prop with unique values by setting options.idProp equal to desired prop. If you wish the component to assign identifiers automatically than just set options.idProp to null . Node caption The visible node text in the component is a node caption. This caption is determined by options.nameProp that can be either string (name of the prop in the source item) or a function that has one parameter item (source item) and must return the node caption. By default options.nameProp=&#39;name&#39; . You can customize what exact prop to use as the caption prop by setting options.nameProp equal to a desired prop or a function. The example of using a function for returning the node caption: 1 this .$refs.treeVue.treeOptions.nameProp = item = item.title Node style classes Every node has four main parts: checkbox, expander, icon, text. Every part can have its own set of style classes. You can either set those classes for all the nodes by setting the corresponding props in options.styleClasses . options.styleClasses has the following props than can contain style classes: checkbox : classes that are added to classes of the node checkbox component, default value is null expander : classes that are added to classes of the node expander component, default value is null icon : classes that are added to classes of the node icon component, default value is null text : classes that are added to classes of the node text component, default value is null Every node can override this classes by setting its own classes for all the node parts and also can have default style that applies to all its parts: default : classes that are added to classes of all the node subcomponents, default value is null checkbox : classes that are added to classes of the node checkbox component, default value is null expander : classes that are added to classes of the node expander component, default value is null icon : classes that are added to classes of the node icon component, default value is null text : classes that are added to classes of the node text component, default value is null To override node classes you can call the corresponding node’s functions.
